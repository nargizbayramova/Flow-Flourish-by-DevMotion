# Flow & Flourish by DevMotion
## Term Project Proposal

### Introduction
Flow & Flourish is a mobile puzzle game designed to combine challenging gameplay with real-world productivity tools. The game's core revolves around a pipe-based puzzle mechanic where players rotate and repair pipes to direct water to a living character — initially a plant. This concept challenges the player's problem-solving abilities under time and move constraints while rewarding productivity through an integrated Pomodoro mode.

### Game Genre and Concept
Flow & Flourish is a mobile puzzle game blending engaging mechanics with productivity-focused elements. Players rotate pipes to create a continuous path that delivers water to a plant character, symbolizing growth and progress. The game offers multiple levels that increase in difficulty. 

The game also features a Pomodoro mode, promoting focused work or study sessions. When players commit to these sessions, they earn in-game currency and see their plant character grow — a tangible reward for real-world productivity. The game includes customization options to appeal to different users. Combining classic puzzle elements with a practical productivity tool, Flow & Flourish provides a dual-purpose experience suitable for both casual gamers and those seeking to improve focus and efficiency.
